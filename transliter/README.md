hist-pl-transliter
==================

The hist-pl-transliter package provides a simple embedded domain specific
language for defining transliteration rules.
Additionally, the package includes a set of rules prepared (within the SYNAT
project) for documents collected throughout the IMPACT project (available
at http://dl.psnc.pl/activities/projekty/impact/results/).

A transliteration system, developed independently within the IMPACT
project, may be also of interest.
It can be found at https://bitbucket.org/jsbien/pol.
