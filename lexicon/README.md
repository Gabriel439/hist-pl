hist-pl-lexicon
===============

The hist-pl-lexicon package implements a binary representation of the historical dictionary of Polish.
It also provides Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) parsing utilities which allow to translate the original
LMF representation of the dictionary to a binary form.


Library
=======

The library provides a simple interface for accessing the contents of the binary dictionary.
See the [NLP.HistPL.Lexicon][hist-pl-module] module for an example of the library usage
and a detailed API description.

Ideas
=====

* Library could provide separate DTD schemas for validation of entire
  dictionary or dictionary fragments.
